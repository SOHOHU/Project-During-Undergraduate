The Loyalty-SMOTE algorithm is an improved version of the SMOTE algorithm. 

It identifies abnormal samples and boundary samples by calculating the Loyalty of each data point, 
and performs oversampling specifically on the boundary samples. 

Compared with traditional imbalanced data processing algorithms, 
the Loyalty-SMOTE algorithm has significantly improved the performance of classifiers, 
especially on multi-class datasets.
