### Overview of Loyalty-SMOTE Algorithm  
The Loyalty-SMOTE algorithm is an improved version of the SMOTE algorithm.  

### Core Mechanism  
It identifies abnormal samples and boundary samples by calculating the Loyalty of each data point, and performs oversampling specifically on the boundary samples.  

### Performance Advantages  
Compared with traditional imbalanced data processing algorithms, the Loyalty-SMOTE algorithm has significantly improved the performance of classifiers, especially on multi-class datasets.
