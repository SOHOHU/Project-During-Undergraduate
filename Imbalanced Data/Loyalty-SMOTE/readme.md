### Core Mechanism  
It identifies abnormal samples and boundary samples by calculating the Loyalty of each data point, and performs oversampling specifically on the boundary samples.  

### Performance Advantages  
Compared with traditional imbalanced data processing algorithms, the Loyalty-SMOTE algorithm has significantly improved the performance of classifiers, especially on multi-class datasets.

The paper "Loyalty-SMOTE: Data Synthesis Algorithm for Effective Imbalanced Data Classification" was submitted to the journal *Neural Networks* in November 2024.
