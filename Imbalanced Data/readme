From November 2022 to December 2024, 
I researched "imbalanced data processing algorithms and their application in dairy cow ketosis prediction".
 
First, I studied imbalanced data handling in dairy cow ketosis prediction, 
developing the RLST-KNN model, which effectively addresses ketosis data imbalance and improves prediction accuracy.
 
Subsequently, I researched imbalanced data processing algorithms, 
proposing Loyalty-SMOTE, a new method that enhances minority class samples while preserving data distribution features, suitable for ketosis risk assessment.
 
These findings were submitted to "Preventive Veterinary Medicine" and "Neural Networks" journals, focusing on applying imbalanced data processing in animal disease prediction, providing technical support for precision livestock farming.
