### Research Period​
From November 2022 to December 2024, I researched "imbalanced data processing algorithms and their application in dairy cow ketosis prediction".​

### Research Content 1: Imbalanced Data Handling in Dairy Cow Ketosis Prediction​
First, I studied imbalanced data handling in dairy cow ketosis prediction, developing the RLST-KNN model, which effectively addresses ketosis data imbalance and improves prediction accuracy.​

### Research Content 2: Proposal of a New Imbalanced Data Processing Algorithm​
Subsequently, I researched imbalanced data processing algorithms, proposing Loyalty-SMOTE, a new method.​

These findings were submitted to "Preventive Veterinary Medicine" and "Neural Networks" journals, focusing on applying imbalanced data processing in animal disease prediction, providing technical support for precision livestock farming.​
