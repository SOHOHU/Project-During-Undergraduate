### Overview of RLST-KNN Method  
Imbalanced data refers to a situation in classification tasks where the number of samples in different classes is significantly unequal. For example, in disease prediction, cases of the disease (positive class) are often far fewer than non-disease cases (negative class). This imbalance can lead machine learning models to be biased toward the majority class, resulting in poor performance in predicting the minority class, which is often the focus of interest.
The RLST-KNN method is a machine learning approach specifically designed for the prediction of dairy cow ketosis, with its advantage lying in effectively handling the phenomena of data imbalance and missing data in datasets.

### Performance Comparison  
Compared with traditional machine learning detection methods, the RLST-KNN method has demonstrated stronger performance and robustness in imbalanced dairy cow ketosis data.
