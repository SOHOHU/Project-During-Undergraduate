The RLST-KNN method is a machine learning approach specifically designed for the prediction of dairy cow ketosis, with its advantage lying in effectively 
handling the phenomena of data imbalance and missing data in datasets.

Compared with traditional machine learning detection methods, the RLST-KNN method has demonstrated 
stronger performance and robustness in imbalanced dairy cow ketosis data.

The relevant paper on this method, 
*RLST-KNN: An Efficient Machine Learning Method for Prediction of Subclinical Ketosis of Dairy Cows Based on Imbalanced Data Processing Algorithm*, 
was submitted to the journal *Genetics* in April 2025.
