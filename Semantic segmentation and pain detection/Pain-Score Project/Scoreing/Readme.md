### Scoring Stage of the Pain-Score Method​

The second step of the Pain-Score method is the scoring stage. After segmenting the key parts of the dairy cow's face using Pain-Deeplab and the dairy cow facial pain scale, a deep learning classifier is applied to score each facial organ of the dairy cow individually. The dairy cow facial pain scale stands as a key achievement in the field of veterinary medicine in recent years.
