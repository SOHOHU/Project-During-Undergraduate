The research on the benefit compensation mechanism of the "Hydro-PV-Wind-Storage" integrated system was the first scientific research project I participated in during my undergraduate studies.

The project was initiated in November 2021 and concluded in December 2023.

As a participant, I was involved in the entire process, mainly responsible for the design of the front-end interface and the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the power generation of hydropower stations and wind power stations.
